# ntua-computer-architecture

Lab Assignments for the [Computer Architecture](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/3357) course, during the 5th semester of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens.

## Lab 01 - Assembly MIPS

This lab was about becoming familiar and working with MIPS Assembly by creating various routines. To implement these routines MIPS emulator like [MILE](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/courses/comparch/assign.go) can be used. In this emulator, MIPS assembly can be executed while monitoring the contents of registers and memory, thus making it easier to develop and test the required code.

## Lab 02 - Pipelined Datapath

This lab was about creating timing diagrams for the execution of a code in a pipelined processor and calculating the total execution time, on different scenarios, considering forwarding mechanisms. It emphasized understanding pipeline execution in a MIPS processor, identifying hazards, and optimizing code execution with these forwarding mechanisms.

## Lab 03 - Memory Hierarchy

This lab was about solving problems related to memory hierarchy, such as calculating hits and misses during the execution of a code or calculating the average memory access time. It aimed to deepen the understanding of cache memory, its role in program execution, and the choices and trade-offs involved in designing and configuring cache hierarchies.

## Lab 04 - Virtual Memory

This lab was about solving problems related to virtual memory, such as designing the page table and calculating hits and misses in the TLB when performing memory accesses. It also assessed the impact of different page sizes on memory efficiency, while exploring various scenarios related to memory management, including single-level page tables and multi-level page tables.
